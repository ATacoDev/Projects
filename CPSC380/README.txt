Submission of cpu.c, cpu.h, schedulers.h, ssched.c, task.h, README.txt, TaskList.txt

Compilation command: gcc *.c -o output
Run command: ./output [priority|sjf|rr|fcfs] <TaskList>

Current Errors/Bugs/Notes:
 - For my round robin programming, I manually input the time quantum of 2
 - Priority scheduling has greater values as higher priority
