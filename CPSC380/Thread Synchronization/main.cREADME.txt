Programming Assignment 5 Producer & Consumer

Submission of main.c, buffer.h, buffer.c, README

Compilation command: gcc *.c -o prodcon
Run command: ./prodcon <sleep time(seconds)> <# producer threads> <#consumer threads>

Current Errors/Bugs/Notes:

 - The first couple times running the program, for some reason the program producers more data than it should. However,
 if you keep running the program it becomes more consistent to how much data is actually produced and consumed.
